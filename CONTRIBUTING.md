## **Here is a brief overview of how to contribute to vscode-seneca-college:**

---

<br>

1. Start by identifying an issue or a feature that you would want to add. Choose a issue from the issues tab that you would like to work on. Feel free to open a new issue in the project if it is not in the list of issues.

<br>

2. In your local GitHub organization, Fork current repository to produce a personal copy of this project by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of your screen. If you leave the default settings, the repository `underyour-GitHub-username/repository-name` will now be appear under your profile.

<br>

3. Make a local copy of the repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/github-username/vscode-seneca-college.
```

4. Create working branch:

```
git checkout -b branch-name
```

5. Include the upstream remote:

```
git push --set-upstream origin branch-name
```

6. If you think your fork is behind, pull the most recent changes from the main repository:

```
git pull upstream main
```

7. Make the necessary adjustments for the problem you're attempting to solve or the feature you want to include.

<br>

8. Merge the modifications into the branch you're working on by adding them to staging.

<br>

9. Make the changes and push them to the remote repository by:

```
git push origin branch-name-here
```

10. Send an upstream repository a **pull request**.

<br>

11. Include a brief description of the modifications made in the pull request's title.

<br>

12. Watch for a maintainer to review the pull request.

<br>

13. Modify the pull request if the maintaining reviewer suggests it.

<br>

14. After your pull request is merged, celebrate your achievement!
