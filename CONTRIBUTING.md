Never contributed to open source before? Are you curious about how contributions function in our project?
Here is a brief summary!

**Here is a brief overview of how to contribute to vscode-seneca-college:**

---

1. Start by identifying an issue or a feature that you would want to add. Choose a issue from the issues tab that you would like to work on. Feel free to open a new issue in the project if it is not in the list of issues.

2. In your local GitHub organization, Fork current repository to produce a personal copy of this project by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of your screen. If you leave the default settings, the repository `underyour-GitHub-username/repository-name` should appear under your profile.

3. Make a local copy of the repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/github-username/vscode-seneca-college.
```

4. Create working branch:

```
git checkout -b branch-name
```

5. Include the upstream remote:

```
git push --set-upstream origin branch-name
```

6. If you think your fork is behind, pull the most recent changes from the main repository:

```
git pull upstream main
```

7. Make the necessary adjustments for the problem you're attempting to solve or the feature you want to include.

8. Merge the modifications into the branch you're working on by adding them to staging.

9. Make the changes and push them to the remote repository by:

```
git push origin branch-name-here
```

10. Send an upstream repository a **pull request**.

11. Include a brief description of the modifications made in the pull request's title.

12. Watch for a maintainer to review the pull request.

13. Modify the pull request if the maintaining reviewer suggests it.

14. After your pull request is merged, celebrate your achievement!

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION!
